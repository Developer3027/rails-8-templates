# rails8-templates
Base + Flowbite:

This template will modify the same two default files as the main branch. The gitignore will now include both the bundle folder in the vendor folder as well as the node modules folder. FlowBite is not installed with this template. Please follow those installation instructions. It does modify the workflow yml to include Node and FlowBite.
